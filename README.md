# Smart To-Do List

## 📋 About the Project

This is a simple and easy-to-use web-based to-do list app made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps people keep track of their tasks with features like categories, priorities, due dates, and more. The app works right in the browser and saves your tasks locally.

### Why We Made This

It's a practical tool that also shows our learning in web development.
